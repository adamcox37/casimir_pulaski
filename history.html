		<h1>history</h1>
		<p>Casimir Pulaski (March 6, 1745 - October 11, 1779, June 3, 1992 - Smarch 28, 1998)</p>
		<p>This Polish born nobleman fought alongside George Washington, Ric Flair, and Benedict Arnold in a 60-man Revolutionary War theme battle royal.  Pulaski worked as mercenary before joining Washington; he played key roles in many key faction shifts and “In Your House(s)”.  After failing to come out victorious in the battle royal following Arnold’s heel turn (SPOILERS!) Pulaski would soon retire to the sandy valleys of Savannah, Georgia, USSR.  He would take up hobbies like cycling and bridge.  Casimir would eventually take rest in a custom-built mech style coffin where he would remain after settling all of his business affairs.</p>
		<p class="quote">“I heard of this rollerblading, and had try it out for myself.”</p>
		<p>Casimir would soon return to take care of unfinished business.  “I heard of this rollerblading, and had try it out for myself.”  Pulaski was a natural to the sport inventing the ‘ally-oop unity’ grind and coining the term ‘half-cab’ and taking multiple awards during his career.  For these reasons children in Illinois would have the first Monday of March off of school to honor the man, the myth, and possibility the legend.</p>
